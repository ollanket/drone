## What

A db and rest api used to manage drones that take pictures. Idea based on an old school project.

## Why

For personal learning purposes. I'm planning to use the tools used in this project later on a bigger project.

## Develop

Spin up the db and pgadmin with

- `yarn test:up`

Start the server

- `yarn build && start`

Run tests with

- `yarn test`

Run server on watch mode

- `yarn dev`
